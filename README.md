### Open-source AIoT platform for industrial environmental monitoring ‚Äî hardware, software, and intelligent interaction.

---

## üß© Overview

**OpenAIoT-Industrial** is an open-source platform that integrates **modular hardware** and **AI-driven software** for real-time environmental monitoring in industrial environments.  
The system combines a **Raspberry Pi Compute Module 5 (CM5)** with a **Sensirion SHT85** temperature and humidity sensor, offering reliable, precise, and expandable sensing capabilities.

Designed as part of a research project at **CIATEQ** , the platform demonstrates how **Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT)** can enhance environmental supervision, automate alerts, and enable natural-language interaction through large language models (LLMs) such as **OpenAI, DeepSeek,** and **Mistral**.
